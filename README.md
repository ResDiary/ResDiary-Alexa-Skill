Current status: Proof of Concept

A skill for Amazon Alexa, which allows you to find restaurant of interest near you.

Example utterances:

* Alexa, ask ResDiary where should we eat?
* Alexa, ask ResDiary where to go for dinner?
* Alexa, open ResDiary
  * Where should we eat?

## AWS CLI setup

To run the test suite or publish this application you need to install AWS's CLI tools, and configure them.

See [AWS CLI documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html) for installation instructions.

After installing this for the first time, you need to run `aws configure` and set an IAM Access Key and Secret to authenticate. For instructions on how to do this, follow [AWS configure CLI documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html).

The region you use should be `eu-west-1`.
